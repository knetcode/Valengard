- **Description**: Volund is the patron of skilled smiths, innovative mechanics, and metalworkers. This god is concerned with the raw talent of the craftsman, the quality of the tool, and the efficient creation of goods for trade. Volund's followers seek perfection in the physical labor of the forge and the workshop, believing that true divinity is found in the meticulous process of creation and the enduring excellence of the finished product. He cares only for skill, regardless of the item's purpose.
- **Worshippers**: Blacksmiths, jewelers, weaponsmiths, tinkers, clockmakers, inventors, and any artisan who relies on skill and patience to craft complex or essential items. They honor Volund by maintaining pristine workshops, never rushing a job, and always seeking to surpass their previous quality of work.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Perfect Hammer Volund gifts you with supernatural crafting speed and an unerring hand in creation. When you spend time crafting a non-magical item, the rate at which you progress (the value of the item you create per day/hour) is doubled. Additionally, once per long rest, you can invoke Volund's focus: before making an attack roll with a weapon you personally crafted or making an ability check with a set of tools in which you are proficient, you can choose to gain advantage on the roll.
