- **Description**: Kaldor is the deity of safe mining, geological abundance, and the retrieval of raw, precious materials. His followers are miners, prospectors, and gem-cutters who work deep beneath the earth. Kaldor values the careful extraction of resources and the protection of those who brave the dark for wealth, ensuring that tunnels hold true and veins run deep. He advocates for respecting the earth and the dangers it holds, demanding proper safety and planning for every descent.
- **Worshippers**: Miners, prospectors, metallurgists, gem-cutters, cavern explorers, engineers specializing in shoring and tunneling, and dwarven clans. They honor Kaldor by always leaving a small offering of metal or stone before an excavation, maintaining safety protocols, and sharing the bounty of a large find.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Stable Earth Kaldor grants you an innate sense of the earth's stability and resistance to its crushing forces. You gain resistance to Bludgeoning damage (representing the crushing weight of stone). Additionally, once per long rest, you can invoke Kaldorâ€™s protection: as a reaction when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage from a collapse, cave-in, earthquake, or other rock-based hazard, you can reduce the damage taken by 3d6. You also gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect unstable ground or hidden geological hazards for the next hour.
