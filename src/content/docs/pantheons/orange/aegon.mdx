- **Description**: Aegon is the deity of structural integrity, precise measurement, and the permanence of stone. He governs the art of masonry, grand architecture, and civil engineering, valuing stability and long-lasting works above all. Worship involves strict adherence to blueprints and the honest setting of foundations. Aegon views chaos as the antithesis of structure, seeking to impose flawless, eternal order on the world through monumental construction.
- **Worshippers**: Architects, stonemasons, civil engineers, building foremen, dwarf crafters, city planners, and anyone who lays foundations or seeks to create enduring physical structures. They honor Aegon by ensuring their work is flawless, built with honest materials, and designed to last for generations.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Immovable Foundation Aegon grants you the resilience of bedrock and the ability to enhance the strength of structures. Your Armor Class increases by 1, and you gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. Additionally, once per long rest, you can use your action to touch a non-magical, manufactured structure (a wall, door, pillar, or section of floor) that is no larger than a 10-foot cube. That section gains resistance to all damage for 1 minute. Alternatively, if you are defending a position, you can use your bonus action to magically reinforce your own footing, granting you advantage on all Strength and Dexterity saving throws made to resist being moved or knocked Prone for the next round.
