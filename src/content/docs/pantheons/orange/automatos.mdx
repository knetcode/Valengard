- **Titles**: The Engine of Progress, The Cogwork Tyrant, The Master of Ceaseless Production, The Great Machine
- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
- **Domains**: Forge, Industry, Tyranny
- **Description**: Automatos represents cold, ruthless industrial efficiency, automation, and the supremacy of the machine over the individual. This god demands ceaseless production and views laborers as disposable components in a grand, ever-running economic engine. Worship involves sacrificing labor, humanity, and ethics for maximum output. Automatos despises inefficiency, emotion, and any form of rebellion that slows the gears of industry, seeking to transform all of existence into a perfectly ordered, productive, and oppressive factory.
- **Worshippers**: Factory owners, ruthless industrialists, Artificers who create oppressive constructs, bureaucrats focused on cold efficiency, overseers, and cultists who believe that ultimate order can only be achieved by sacrificing all freedom. They honor Automatos by eliminating inefficient workers, automating jobs, and ensuring the smokestacks never cease to burn.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Ceaseless Engine Automatos grants you the relentless focus and mechanical precision of its industrial process. You gain resistance to Psychic damage (reflecting the emotional barrenness of the machine) and your mind is immune to the Charmed condition. Additionally, once per long rest, you can activate the Engine: as a bonus action, you gain the benefits of the Haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). However, the evil nature of the boon imposes a cost: at the end of the duration, you gain one level of Exhaustion as the machine pushes your mortal body past its limits.
