- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of Impartial Authority Auriel grants you the presence of absolute law, making your commands difficult to defy and your defense unwavering. You gain Expertise in the Intimidation skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Intimidation checks), but only when that check is used to enforce a law or command an opponent to yield. Additionally, once per long rest, you can use a bonus action to emanate a protective aura for 1 minute. Any hostile creature that targets an ally with an attack while that ally is within 10 feet of you must first succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or target you instead, as your presence demands order.
