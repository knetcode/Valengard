- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Domains**: Knowledge, Grave, Protection
- **Description**: Alethion is the keeper of sacred truth and the silent protector of those wrongly accused. This deity focuses on the investigation of wrongdoing, gathering impartial evidence, and ensuring final judgment is based on the cold facts, not emotion. Alethion views truth as an absolute, permanent structure that must be uncovered and defended. He demands meticulous evidence collection and the rejection of all bias, believing that true justice is inevitable when the full, unvarnished truth is known.
- **Worshippers**: Judges, investigators, detectives, forensic experts, victims of false accusation, honest lawyers, and chroniclers who focus on objective fact. They honor Alethion through silent meditation on justice, rigorous cross-checking of all evidence, and rituals dedicated to purifying a crime scene of all falsehoods.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of Impartial Truth Alethion grants you the ability to discern truth from falsehood and makes you a powerful force against injustice. You gain Expertise in the Insight skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Insight checks). Additionally, once per long rest, you can invoke the Silent Judge: as a reaction when a creature within 30 feet attempts to make a saving throw to resist an effect that would reveal its location, its true form, or a lie it has told (such as a spell like Zone of Truth or See Invisibility), you can impose disadvantage on that creature's saving throw.
