- **Description**: Neria is the deity of the sanctity of the home, familial bonds, and boundless hospitality. This god represents the emotional core of the family unit, ensuring that comfort and cheerful warmth prevail within the household. Her worship emphasizes welcoming travelers, celebrating kin, and maintaining the bright, eternal flame of the communal hearth. Neria sees the home as a sacred sanctuary that should be a source of strength and healing, and she fiercely protects the innocent within its walls.

They honor Neria by keeping a clean and welcoming home, always sharing their food with guests, and ensuring the family hearth or lamp is never extinguished.
