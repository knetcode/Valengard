- **Description**: Neria is the deity of the sanctity of the home, familial bonds, and boundless hospitality. This god represents the emotional core of the family unit, ensuring that comfort and cheerful warmth prevail within the household. Her worship emphasizes welcoming travelers, celebrating kin, and maintaining the bright, eternal flame of the communal hearth. Neria sees the home as a sacred sanctuary that should be a source of strength and healing, and she fiercely protects the innocent within its walls.

You gain Expertise in the Medicine skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Medicine checks). Additionally, once per long rest, you can use a bonus action to designate a 30-foot-radius area around a campfire, hearth, or other small, active source of heat. For the next hour, this area becomes a sanctuary: any friendly creature that starts its turn in the area regains 1d6 hit points, and any such creature gains advantage on saving throws against the Frightened condition.
