This god fuels the intense emotional drive of champions, athletes, and duelists who fight not out of necessity, but to prove they are the absolute best. Vydra's followers value bold challenges and the adrenaline of high-stakes contests, believing that the greatest achievement is to stand alone in the spotlight of victory. Vydra despises cowardice, resignation, and anyone who settles for second place.
- **Worshippers**: Gladiators, athletes, duelists, boastful heroes, arrogant sorcerers, competitive gamblers, and anyone driven by the need to be publicly recognized as superior. They honor Vydra by accepting difficult challenges, never retreating from a fair fight, and loudly proclaiming their own achievements.

- **Active Boon**: Unyielding Champion - Once per long rest, after you successfully reduce an enemies hitpoints to 0, you can force your next weapon attack to be a critical hit.
