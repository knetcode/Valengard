- **Description**: Vydra is the deity of competitive pride, overwhelming self-confidence, and the pursuit of victory for personal glory. This god fuels the intense emotional drive of champions, athletes, and duelists who fight not out of necessity, but to prove they are the absolute best. Vydra's followers value bold challenges and the adrenaline of high-stakes contests, believing that the greatest achievement is to stand alone in the spotlight of victory. Vydra despises cowardice, resignation, and anyone who settles for second place.
- **Worshippers**: Gladiators, athletes, duelists, boastful heroes, arrogant sorcerers, competitive gamblers, and anyone driven by the need to be publicly recognized as superior. They honor Vydra by accepting difficult challenges, never retreating from a fair fight, and loudly proclaiming their own achievements.

- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Unyielding Ego Vydra grants you an unshakeable belief in your own superiority, turning confidence into power. You gain Expertise in the Athletics skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Athletics checks). Additionally, once per long rest, immediately after you successfully reduce an opponent's hit points to zero, you can use a bonus action to tap into the thrill of victory. You gain advantage on your next attack roll and impose disadvantage on the first attack roll made against you before the start of your next turn, as your glow of victory is distracting and intimidating.
