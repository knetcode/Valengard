- **Titles**: The Golden Hand, The Lord of Opulence, The Consummate Glutton, The Aristocrat of Excess
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral
- **Domains**: Wealth, Lust, Deception
- **Description**: Midas is the deity of consummate greed, aristocratic excess, and snobbish self-indulgence. This god celebrates the highest form of opulent living, viewing immense wealth as the only true measure of worth. Followers pursue endless luxury, believing their superiority entitles them to exploit others to maintain their fabulous, self-centered existence. Midas encourages a life built on fleeting pleasure, insatiable desire, and the manipulation of the masses to secure yet more gold.
- **Worshippers**: Wealthy nobles, corrupt merchants, hedonistic cultists, power-hungry politicians, master manipulators, and anyone obsessed with material wealth and luxury. They honor Midas with extravagant banquets, public displays of wealth, and by ruthlessly increasing their fortune at the expense of the less fortunate.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Golden Touch Midas grants you an aura of irresistible wealth and chaotic influence. You gain Expertise in the Deception skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Deception checks). Additionally, once per long rest, you can invoke the Golden Touch: as a bonus action, you can magically coat a single object (no larger than a 5-foot cube) that you touch with a thin layer of glittery gold for 1 minute. More powerfully, you can target one creature within 30 feet that can see you. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from the Charmed condition until the end of its next turn, as your opulent presence and sheer audacity overwhelm its senses.
