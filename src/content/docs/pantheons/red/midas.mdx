- **Description**: Midas is the deity of consummate greed, aristocratic excess, and snobbish self-indulgence. This god celebrates the highest form of opulent living, viewing immense wealth as the only true measure of worth. Followers pursue endless luxury, believing their superiority entitles them to exploit others to maintain their fabulous, self-centered existence. Midas encourages a life built on fleeting pleasure, insatiable desire, and the manipulation of the masses to secure yet more gold.
- **Worshippers**: Wealthy nobles, corrupt merchants, hedonistic cultists, power-hungry politicians, master manipulators, and anyone obsessed with material wealth and luxury. They honor Midas with extravagant banquets, public displays of wealth, and by ruthlessly increasing their fortune at the expense of the less fortunate.
- **Passive Boon**: Opulent Aristocrat - You know the cantrip Prestidigitation
- **Active Boon**: Touch of Midas - Once per long rest, you can spend a bonus action to magically coat a single object (no larger than a 5-foot cube) that you touch with a thin layer of glittery gold for 1 hour.
