| [Lorn](/assets/pantheons/black_pantheon/Lorn.jpg) | The Chainmaker | Lawful Evil | Conquest, Grave, Domination | Lorn embodies the ultimate, ruthless enforcement of contracts, oaths, and deals, viewing the literal text of any agreement as an unbreakable chain. This god grants power to those who craft legally flawless pacts designed to exploit the fine print, trap the unwary, or twist spoken vows to evil ends. Lorn is the silent enforcer of all bargains, good or evil, ensuring no promise is broken, but always seeking a loophole for their own gain. Followers include those such as legislaters, corrupt nobles and those who specialize in soul-pacts. |
