- **Titles**: The Chainmaker, The King of Contracts, The Keeper of Oaths
- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
- **Domains**: Oaths, Contracts, Domination
- **Description**: Lorn is the chilling embodiment of absolute, unyielding obligation. He is not a god of justice, but a god of enforcement, driven by a cosmic indifference to the moral implications of any agreement. For the people of Valengard, Lorn's power is the silent truth that underpins every promise, every treaty, and every legal statute: once sworn, it must be paid, and the price is always exacted.
- **Worshippers**: Legislators, magistrates, those who specialize in crafting soul-pacts. They see Lorn in the power of an ironclad law and the inevitability of obligation.
- **Passive Boon**: Oath Maker - You are able to swear oaths under the power of Lorn. You can use this in order to gain advantage on Persuasion checks.
- **Active Boon**: Chainmaker - You gain a +1 bonus to your spell save DC and spell attack rolls for spells that impose the Paralyzed, Restrained or Incapacitated conditions.
