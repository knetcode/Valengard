| [Xyrxos](/assets/pantheons/black_pantheon/Xyrxos.jpg) | The Bringer of Scourges | Chaotic Evil | Death, Corruption, Blight | Xyrxos is the god of corruption, plague, and spiteful destruction, finding joy in seeing order and life crumble into chaos and decay. He is worshipped by nihilists and sadists who wish to see the world suffer. His touch turns fields barren and bodies rotten, representing malice against nature. |
