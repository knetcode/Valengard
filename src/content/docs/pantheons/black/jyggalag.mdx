| [Jyggalag](/assets/pantheons/black_pantheon/Jyggalag.jpg) | The Unraveler of Minds | Chaotic Neutral | Chaos, Madness, Illusion | Jyggalag is the deity of mental fragmentation, paranoia, and the collapse of rational thought. This god seeks to inflict terror, confusion, and psychological ruin, preferring to destroy the mind rather than the body. Jyggalag's influence drives mortals to self-destruction, violent paranoia, or catatonic delusion. Followers are often insane mystics and nihilists who crave the ultimate destruction of the ego and revel in psychological chaos, seeing the world as a meaningless delusion. |
