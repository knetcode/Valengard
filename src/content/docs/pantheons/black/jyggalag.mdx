- **Titles**: The Unraveler of Minds, The Mad God, The Shadow of Reason
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral
- **Domains**: Chaos, Madness, Paranoia
- **Description**: Jyggalag is the deity of mental fragmentation, paranoia, and the collapse of rational thought. This god scoffs at rational thought and revels in insanity, preferring to destroy the mind rather than the body. Jyggalag's influence drives mortals to self-destruction, violent paranoia, or catatonic delusion.
- **Worshippers**: Insane mystics, paranoid schemers, nihilists, and those who seek to prove that all reality is a meaningless delusion. Their rites often involve chaotic, destructive acts that break social and psychological norms.
- **Passive Boon**: Unraveler's Mind - Advantage on saving throws against mental state altering effects.
- **Active Boon**: Shattering Sanity - Once per long rest, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed by crippling paranoia and confusion, suffering the effects of the Confusion spell until the end of its next turn.
