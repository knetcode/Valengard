- **Titles**: The Bringer of Scourges, The Lord of Blight, The Malicious Rot
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
- **Domains**: Decay, Corruption, Blight
- **Description**: Xyrxos is the god of corruption, plague, and decay, finding joy in seeing order and life crumble. His touch turns fields barren and bodies rotten, representing malice against nature and a desire to undo all creation through disease and putrefaction. Xyrxosâ€™s seeks to spread pestilence not for a grand goal, but for the sheer, wicked pleasure of watching others decay.
- **Worshippers**: Nihilists, sadists, plague cultists, alchemists focused on biological and chemical warfare, and mad apothecaries. They honor Xyrxos by polluting water sources, spreading infectious diseases, and conducting cruel experiments to hasten the decay of living creatures and fertile land.
- **Passive Boon**: Plaguebearer - You gain resistance to Poison damage and advantage on saving throws against the Poisoned condition.
- **Active Boon**: Plaguebringer - Once per long rest as an action, you can force all creatures of your choice within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and is affected by the Poisoned condition until the end of its next turn, as their body begins to visibly rot.
