- **Titles**: The Bloodied Hand, The Mistress of Murder, The Queen of the Red Mist
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
- **Domains**: Slaughter, Blood, Madness
- **Description**: Viscera is the deity of impulsive rage, ritual murder, and savage destruction. Driven purely by primal bloodlust and destructive mania, this god despises strategy and seeks to unleash chaos and mass slaughter upon the world. Cults dedicated to Viscera perform horrifying sacrifices, painting temples and streets with the blood of their victims to honor the raw, destructive impulse that governs the deity.
- **Worshippers**: Berserkers, frenzied cultists, serial killers, savage tribes who practice ritual sacrifice, and anyone who embraces the loss of control in favor of overwhelming violence. They believe that true existence is found only in the throes of unthinking, destructive rage.
- **Passive Boon**: Bloodied Blade - Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your character level.
- **Active Boon**: Bloodied Frenzy - Once per long rest, you can use your bonus action after you have made a weapon attack to make an additional weapon attack with advantage.
