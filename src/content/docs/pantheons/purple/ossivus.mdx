- **Description**: Ossivus is the god of metaphysical death, the moment of passage, and the integrity of the soul. This deity ensures that all souls find their intended destination in the afterlife, protecting them from being corrupted, stolen, or held back from their final journey by undeath or binding magic. Ossivus is neither malevolent nor comforting, simply necessaryâ€”the inevitable force that ushers all things to their designated end. His work is done in silence, without judgment on the life lived.
- **Worshippers**: Gravediggers, undertakers, morticians, death wardens, philosophers of the afterlife, and individuals dedicated to hunting down necromancers and undead. They honor Ossivus through solemn silence, rituals that ensure a body is ready for the soul's release, and meticulous protection of final resting places.
- **Passive Boon**: Soulkeeper - You have advantage on Death Saving Throws, additionally you cannot roll a 1 on a Death Saving Throw.
- **Active Boon**: Guide Undead - Once per long rest, you can target all Undead creatures with a 60 foot radius of you. Targets take a number of d8s equal to your character level of Radiant damage (for example, level 1: 1d8 and level 9: 9d8). Additionally targets must make a DC18 Wisdom Saving or be Incapacitated for one turn.
