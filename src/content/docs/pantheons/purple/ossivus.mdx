- **Titles**: The Quiet Guide, The Gatekeeper of the Crossing, The Keeper of the Soul's Integrity, The Necessary End
- **Alignment**: True Neutral
- **Domains**: Grave, Death, Soul
- **Description**: Ossivus is the god of metaphysical death, the moment of passage, and the integrity of the soul. This deity ensures that all souls find their intended destination in the afterlife, protecting them from being corrupted, stolen, or held back from their final journey by undeath or binding magic. Ossivus is neither malevolent nor comforting, simply necessaryâ€”the inevitable force that ushers all things to their designated end. His work is done in silence, without judgment on the life lived.
- **Worshippers**: Gravediggers, undertakers, morticians, death wardens, philosophers of the afterlife, and individuals dedicated to hunting down necromancers and undead. They honor Ossivus through solemn silence, rituals that ensure a body is ready for the soul's release, and meticulous protection of final resting places.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Unclaimed Soul Ossivus grants you command over the passage of souls and protects you from the grip of undeath. You gain resistance to Necrotic damage and have advantage on all saving throws against effects created by Undead creatures. Additionally, once per long rest, you can touch a corpse that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. You can use your action to invoke Ossivus, preventing the soul from being snatched: the corpse cannot be magically raised as an Undead creature for 24 hours, and any attempt to use the Speak with Dead spell on the corpse has disadvantage on the spell save DC.
