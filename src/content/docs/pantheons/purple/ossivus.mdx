| [Ossivus](/assets/pantheons/purple_pantheon/Ossivus.jpg) | The Quiet Guide | True Neutral | Grave, Death, Soul | Ossivus is the god of metaphysical death, the moment of passage, and the integrity of the soul. This deity ensures that all souls find their intended destination in the afterlife, protecting them from being corrupted, stolen, or held back from their final journey. Ossivus is neither malevolent nor comforting, simply necessary. |
