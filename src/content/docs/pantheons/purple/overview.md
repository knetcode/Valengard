| [Parca](/assets/pantheons/purple_pantheon/Parca.jpg) | The Thread Weaver | Lawful Neutral | Foretelling, Time, Fate | Parca is the deity who weaves the ultimate pattern of destiny, overseeing the grand, fixed causality of the universe. She governs prophecies, unavoidable outcomes, and the belief that all events, mortal and divine, are part of a massive, pre-ordained order. Worshipers seek to understand their small role in her cosmic tapestry. |
| [Somnus](/assets/pantheons/purple_pantheon/Somnus.jpg) | The Dream Walker | Neutral | Illusion, Sleep, Dreams | Somnus governs the realm of dreams, imagination, and the mind's inner sanctuary. This deity guides souls through sleep, sending cryptic visions, warnings, or illusions. His domain touches the border between the real and the imagined, making him the patron of artists, seers, and those who seek truth in subconscious thought. |
| [Alea](/assets/pantheons/purple_pantheon/Alea.jpg) | The Bringer of Fortune | Chaotic Good | Luck, Travel, Chance | Alea represents random chance, fortunate accidents, and the thrill of the unexpected twist of fate. This god is worshipped by gamblers, travelers, and adventurers who rely on a sudden turn of luck to survive or succeed. Alea embodies the idea that destiny is not fixed, but subject to random, benevolent chaos. |
| [Ossivus](/assets/pantheons/purple_pantheon/Ossivus.jpg) | The Quiet Guide | True Neutral | Grave, Death, Soul | Ossivus is the god of metaphysical death, the moment of passage, and the integrity of the soul. This deity ensures that all souls find their intended destination in the afterlife, protecting them from being corrupted, stolen, or held back from their final journey. Ossivus is neither malevolent nor comforting, simply necessary. |
| [Nyxos](/assets/pantheons/purple_pantheon/Nyxos.jpg) | The Cosmic Unknown | Chaotic Neutral | Astral, Chaos, Secrets | Nyxos is the boundless deity of the astral plane, the void between worlds, and the terrifying expanse of cosmic secrets. This entity represents the incomprehensible, raw energy of the outer dark and the mysteries that lie beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Exposure to Nyxos's power often results in enlightenment or madness. |
