- **Titles**: The Cosmic Unknown, The Star-Eater, The Architects of the Outer Dark, The Incomprehensible Void
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral
- **Domains**: Astral, Chaos, Secrets
- **Description**: Nyxos is the boundless deity of the astral plane, the void between worlds, and the terrifying expanse of cosmic secrets. This entity represents the incomprehensible, raw energy of the outer dark and the mysteries that lie beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Exposure to Nyxos's power often results in enlightenment or madness, as its truth is too vast for simple sanity. It seeks to break down all restrictive logic, allowing for the free flow of unpredictable, alien thought and power into the material world.
- **Worshippers**: Aberrant cultists, hermits driven mad by celestial insights, warlocks with cosmic patrons, high-level arcanists obsessed with extra-planar energy, and explorers who venture into the deep Astral Sea. They honor Nyxos through rituals that defy earthly physics, attempts to communicate with alien entities, and by embracing existential dread and chaos.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Cosmic Whisper Nyxos grants you the ability to channel the mind-shattering insights of the void. You gain resistance to Force damage (the damage of raw, planar energy). Additionally, once per long rest, you can use your action to channel the cosmic entropy of Nyxos: target one creature within 60 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted by a brief moment of crippling cosmic insight. The creature must use its movement to move in a random direction (determined by a d8) and cannot take any actions or reactions until the end of its next turn.
