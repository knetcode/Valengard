- **Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral
- **Domains**: Astral, Chaos, Secrets
- **Description**: Nyxos is the boundless deity of the astral plane, the void between worlds, and the terrifying expanse of cosmic secrets. This entity represents the incomprehensible, raw energy of the outer dark and the mysteries that lie beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Exposure to Nyxos's power often results in enlightenment or madness, as its truth is too vast for simple sanity. It seeks to break down all restrictive logic, allowing for the free flow of unpredictable, alien thought and power into the material world.
- **Worshippers**: Aberrant cultists, hermits driven mad by celestial insights, warlocks with cosmic patrons, high-level arcanists obsessed with extra-planar energy, and explorers who venture into the deep Astral Sea. They honor Nyxos through rituals that defy earthly physics, attempts to communicate with alien entities, and by embracing existential dread and chaos.
- **Passive Boon**: Void Whisperer - You know the cantrip Message
- **Active Boon**: Cosmic Secrets - Once per long rest, you can spend your action to attempt to stun any creature you can see within 60 feet. The opposing create must make a DC18 Wisdom saving throw.
