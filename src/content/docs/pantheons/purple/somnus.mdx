- **Titles**: The Dream Walker, The Shaper of Visions, The Gatekeeper of the Mind, The Weaver of the Inner Sanctum
- **Alignment**: Neutral
- **Domains**: Illusion, Sleep, Dreams
- **Description**: Somnus governs the realm of dreams, imagination, and the mind's inner sanctuary. This deity guides souls through sleep, sending cryptic visions, warnings, or illusions. His domain touches the border between the real and the imagined, making him the patron of artists, seers, and those who seek truth in subconscious thought. Somnus is impartial, recognizing that dreams can be sources of both profound healing and debilitating nightmares, and seeks only to ensure that the veil between consciousness and the dream-realm remains intact.
- **Worshippers**: Artists, poets, seers, interpreters of dreams, mystics, insomniacs, and anyone who uses their imagination or altered states of consciousness to perceive truth. They honor Somnus through quiet meditation, consuming gentle narcotics or herbal aids to induce vivid dreams, and meticulously recording and interpreting their nocturnal visions.
- **Passive Boon**: Insomniac - The sleep and unconscious condition cannot be forced onto you by any means while your hit points are 1 or more.
- **Active Boon**: Dream Walker - Once per long rest, you can ritual cast the spell Sending. The target will receive your message the next time they go to sleep. The target will need to make a DC20 Wisdom Saving Throw, if they fail they will answer you openly and honestly. You can choose whether or not the target will remember this.
