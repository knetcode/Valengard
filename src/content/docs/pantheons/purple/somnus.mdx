- **Titles**: The Dream Walker, The Shaper of Visions, The Gatekeeper of the Mind, The Weaver of the Inner Sanctum
- **Alignment**: Neutral
- **Domains**: Illusion, Sleep, Dreams
- **Description**: Somnus governs the realm of dreams, imagination, and the mind's inner sanctuary. This deity guides souls through sleep, sending cryptic visions, warnings, or illusions. His domain touches the border between the real and the imagined, making him the patron of artists, seers, and those who seek truth in subconscious thought. Somnus is impartial, recognizing that dreams can be sources of both profound healing and debilitating nightmares, and seeks only to ensure that the veil between consciousness and the dream-realm remains intact.
- **Worshippers**: Artists, poets, seers, interpreters of dreams, mystics, insomniacs, and anyone who uses their imagination or altered states of consciousness to perceive truth. They honor Somnus through quiet meditation, consuming gentle narcotics or herbal aids to induce vivid dreams, and meticulously recording and interpreting their nocturnal visions.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Inner Sanctum Somnus grants you a measure of control over the dream-realm and makes your mind a fortress against invasion. You gain resistance to Psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against effects that would put you to sleep. Additionally, once per long rest, you can slip a suggestion into the subconscious of a nearby foe: as a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet that can hear you. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) check, as the voice of Somnus fills its thoughts with distracting or misleading internal noise.
