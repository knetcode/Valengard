She encourages her followers to take risks, trust their gut, and embrace the unpredictability of life, knowing that fortune favors the bold.

- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Smiling Die Alea grants you an extraordinary surge of luck that can avert disaster. When you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to magically re-roll the d20. The creature must use the new roll. You can use this boon once per short or long rest. Additionally, whenever you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll or ability check, you regain 1d4 hit points, as Alea's favor instantly heals minor wounds.
