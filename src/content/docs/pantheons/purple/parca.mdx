- **Titles**: The Thread Weaver, The Inevitable Thread, The Grand Fatesmith, The Silent Spinner
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Domains**: Foretelling, Time, Fate
- **Description**: Parca is the deity who weaves the ultimate pattern of destiny, overseeing the grand, fixed causality of the universe. She governs prophecies, unavoidable outcomes, and the belief that all events, mortal and divine, are part of a massive, pre-ordained order. Worshipers seek to understand their small role in her cosmic tapestry. Parca is utterly impartial and unchanging, finding no joy or sorrow in destiny, only the satisfaction of the pattern being perfectly realized.
- **Worshippers**: Diviners, fatalistic sages, astrologers, mystics, cloistered monks who study the movement of the stars, and those who believe their lives are bound by an unbreakable destiny. They honor Parca through long periods of meditation, deciphering omens, and accepting hardship without resistance, seeing it as a necessary knot in the thread.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Fatespun Thread Parca grants you a minor understanding of the destined flow of events, allowing you to subtly tug on the threads of fate. You gain Expertise in the Insight skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Insight checks). Additionally, once per long rest, immediately after an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw is made by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to change the result by adding or subtracting 1d4. You must declare this action after the initial roll is made but before the result is applied.
