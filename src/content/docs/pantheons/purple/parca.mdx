- **Description**: Parca is the deity who weaves the ultimate pattern of destiny, overseeing the grand, fixed causality of the universe. She governs prophecies, unavoidable outcomes, and the belief that all events, mortal and divine, are part of a massive, pre-ordained order. Worshipers seek to understand their small role in her cosmic tapestry. Parca is utterly impartial and unchanging, finding no joy or sorrow in destiny, only the satisfaction of the pattern being perfectly realized.
- **Worshippers**: Diviners, fatalistic sages, astrologers, mystics, cloistered monks who study the movement of the stars, and those who believe their lives are bound by an unbreakable destiny. They honor Parca through long periods of meditation, deciphering omens, and accepting hardship without resistance, seeing it as a necessary knot in the thread.
