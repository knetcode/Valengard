- **Titles**: The Nexus of Power, The Grand Mage, The Apex of Arcana
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral
- **Domains**: Arcana, Efficiency, Power
- **Description**: Rathos is the deity of raw, efficient magical might and ruthless optimization of spellcraft. This god focuses on the cold, logical means required to achieve maximum arcane power, regardless of ethical concerns or consequences. Rathos guides mages who seek perfection through mastery of energy flow and spell manipulation, believing that the only true good is the successful, potent casting of a spell, and that collateral damage is simply a mathematical necessity.
- **Worshippers**: Battle mages, ambitious Sorcerers and Wizards, self-proclaimed "power gamers," and cultists who perform calculated sacrifices to fuel destructive magic. They revere Rathos by meticulously improving their spellcasting efficiency, learning banned or ethically dubious spells, and always seeking the highest possible damage output.
- **Passive Boon**: Nexus Caster - You learn one cantrip from any class list of the evocation school.
- **Active Boon**: Arcana Maximum - Once per day, when you can use your bonus action to roll your damage dice for a spell twice and use the higher result.
