- **Description**: Alkahest is the god of Alchemy, Transmutation, and the technical mastery of material science. Worshiped by chemists, master enchanters, and potion-makers, this deity focuses on applying logic and arcane theory to manipulate matter, seeking the 'perfect form' or the legendary Philosopher's Stone. Seeing no inherent moral value in the methods of work, only the elegance and success of the transformation itself. Their influence drives mortals to seek fundamental knowledge of the world's constituent parts.
- **Worshippers**: Alchemists, master brewers, Transmutation Wizards, Artificers, expert metallurgists, enchanters, and philosophical scholars who seek to master the laws of physics and magic. They conduct their rituals in immaculate laboratories and forges, often involving complex experiments and the successful creation of rare or potent concoctions.
