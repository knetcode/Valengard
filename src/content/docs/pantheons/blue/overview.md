title: Blue Pantheon
---

The Blue Pantheon embodies the pursuit of Knowledge, Structure, and Abstract Power. These deities are largely concerned with the underlying mechanics of the cosmosâ€”logic, time, causality, and the mastery of arcana. They are often Neutral or Lawful Neutral, prioritizing objective truth and the perfection of systems over morality. This Pantheon guides scholars, mages, and thinkers who seek to catalogue the universe and manipulate its raw, complex energies.
