- **Titles**: The Keeper of Eras, The Grand Mathematician, The Unmoving Center, The Source of the Arcane Law
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Domains**: Mathematics, Order, Time
- **Description**: Chronos governs the abstract structure of time, causality, and universal magical principles. This deity is worshipped by high-level arcane practitioners and temporal mages who study the mathematics and physics of magic to predict and manipulate the flow of existence. Chronos is utterly impartial, viewing all events—past, present, and future—as points on a fixed, eternal timeline. Their sole concern is that the laws governing magic and time remain unbroken.
- **Worshippers**: Temporal mages, philosophers, astronomers, researchers of planar travel, and cloistered scholars who dedicate their lives to uncovering the primordial equations that define reality. They venerate Chronos through precise, mathematically perfect rituals and by tracking celestial movements.
- **Passive Boon**: Temporal Restoration - You gain the cantrip Mending
- **Active Boon**: Temporal Consistency - Once per long rest, you can use your reaction reroll any d20 roll until you get a minimum of 10 on the d20. You can use this after the initial dice is rolled.
