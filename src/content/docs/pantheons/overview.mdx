title: Pantheon Overview
---

The spiritual reality of Valengard is not dictated by a single deity or a unified Heaven, but by a complex, often conflicting tapestry woven by six core Pantheons. These divine groups are the unseen architects of all existence, each embodying a fundamental concept—be it law, chaos, creation, or destruction. Every force, from the most rigid legal code to the wildest storm, is guided by the will of these gods.

These Pantheons define the mortal condition, as their domains shape everything mortals experience: the warmth of the Hearth (Red), the unyielding pressure of Fate (Purple), the growth of the Harvest (Green), and the stability of the Stone (Orange).

While the gods are immortal and immensely powerful, they are not a harmonious family. Each Pantheon operates with a distinct, often polarized alignment and agenda. This fundamental tension—between the Lawful Good ideals of the White Pantheon and the Chaotic Evil malice of the Black Pantheon—is the primary engine of conflict in Valengard. Their cosmic struggles manifest as wars, plagues, miracles, and grand historical shifts that constantly challenge the morality and survival of the mortal world.

To live in Valengard is to live under the watchful and often competing gazes of these six divine orders, with every choice, action, and vow having implications for the cosmic balance they maintain.
