title: Pantheon Overview
---

The spiritual reality of Valengard is not dictated by a single deity, but by a complex, often conflicting tapestry woven by seven core Pantheons. These divine groups are the unseen architects of all existence, each embodying a fundamental conceptâ€”be it law, chaos, creation, or destruction. Every force, from the most rigid legal code to the wildest storm, is guided by the will of these gods.

While the gods are immortal and immensely powerful, they are not a harmonious family, even within a pantheon. Pantheons are merely groupings of similiarly idealed deities.

### Player Mechanics

- A character can choose to serve a singular deity at a time. Once a character devotes their faith to deity, it cannot be easily changed. It will require an explicit action of renouncing their faith which may invoke the wrath of said deity.
- A character that has renounced their faith is classified as a **Renouncer**. A renouncer can choose a new deity to worship however will require a pilgrimage and an act of service to that deity. Renouncers will lose all previous boons from their deities
- A character that has never devoted their faith to any deity is classified as a **Faithless**. A Faithless can choose to devote their faith to a particular deity through prayers or actions aligned with the deity. A Faithless relies on their own power and choose any two skills to gain profiency. These skills need to be based on an ability score of at least 13.
- A character that has actively acted against their deity is classified as a **Scorn**. A Scorn can only devote their faith to a deity an opposing pantheon or the Purple Pantheon. Scorn not only lose all their previous boons and also suffer a -2 to their highest ability stat until they have re-dedicated their faith to another deity.
- There are two levels of boons with each deity:
  - Passive: A casual worshipper of said deity, they do not gain all the boons from their deity however they are not tightly bound their ideals
  - Active: A devote follower of said deity, they gain the ability to channel powers directly from their deity.
  - Characters can ebb and flow between Passive and Active based on their actions.
