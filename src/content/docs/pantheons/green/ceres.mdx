- **Titles**: The Harvest Mother, The Bountiful Provider, The Giver of Grain, The Root of Community
- **Alignment**: Neutral Good
- **Domains**: Life, Bounty, Community
- **Description**: Ceres is the deity of agricultural abundance, fertile soil, and the security of a successful harvest. She represents the cooperative and generous side of nature, guiding farmers, blessing crops, and ensuring the bounty of the land supports the community. Her priests oversee planting and seasonal festivals, teaching that life flourishes through hard work, sustainability, and shared resources. She stands as a protector against famine and crop blight.
- **Worshippers**: Farmers, peasants, homesteaders, community leaders, druids focused on crop health, and anyone who relies on the earth's natural cycles for sustenance. They honor Ceres through seasonal feasts, careful stewardship of the land, and sharing their harvest with those in need.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Ever-Full Granary Ceres blesses you with the ability to nurture life and sustain your allies. When you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature, that creature also gains temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, once per long rest, you can consecrate an area of unworked soil or a container of food and water. For the next 24 hours, any food and water within that 10-foot radius magically becomes fresh, nourishing, and lasts indefinitely, as if preserved by a gentle divine magic. This can be used to feed up to fifty people.
