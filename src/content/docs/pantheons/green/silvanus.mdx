- **Titles**: The Old Man of the Forest, The Verdant Keeper, The Lord of the Untamed Cycle, The Great Oak
- **Alignment**: True Neutral
- **Domains**: Nature, Seasons, Wilderness
- **Description**: Silvanus is the embodiment of the forest and the ancient, unchanging rhythm of the wilderness. This god enforces the cycle of growth and destruction without moral judgment; the wolf must eat the deer, and the wildfire clears space for new saplings. Followers dedicate themselves to preserving the balance of ecosystems, respecting the territories of wild nature, and resisting the encroachment of civilization. His presence is felt in the deep, silent woods, the crash of a falling tree, and the quiet return of life after winter.
- **Worshippers**: Druids, Rangers, hermits, treants, hunters who respect their prey, and isolated communities that live in harmony with the wild. They honor Silvanus by protecting ancient trees, observing the natural boundaries of the wild, and never taking more from the environment than they need.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Untamed Cycle Silvanus grants you the resilience and vitality of the enduring wilderness. When you are in a natural environment (such as a forest, swamp, or mountain), you gain advantage on all saving throws against the Poisoned condition and against effects that would cause you to suffer from Exhaustion. Additionally, once per long rest, you can harness the raw energy of the wild: as an action, you can cause vines and roots to erupt from the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 60 feet. The area becomes Difficult Terrain until the start of your next turn, and any hostile creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.
