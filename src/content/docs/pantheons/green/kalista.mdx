- **Titles**: The Deep Tide, The Siren's Embrace, The Abyssal Queen, The Whisper of the Trench
- **Alignment**: True Neutral
- **Domains**: Water, Tempest, Knowledge
- **Description**: Kalista governs the depths of the oceans, the bounty of all aquatic life, and the silent, crushing pressure of the abyssal dark. She watches over fish, sea creatures, and those who subsist by fishing, ruling over the ebb and flow of all waterâ€”from the smallest spring to the widest sea. Her domain is the vast, amoral power of the deep, embodying the wisdom of unplumbed mysteries and the sudden violence of the storm. She demands absolute respect for the waters and the creatures within, viewing life as just another current.
- **Worshippers**: Sailors, fishermen, coastal communities, aquatic races (such as merfolk and tritons), storm wizards, and explorers of the deep seas. They honor Kalista by leaving offerings of precious objects at the ocean's edge, avoiding the wasteful slaughter of sea creatures, and performing rituals that seek to placate her tempestuous nature.
- **Passive Boon**: Seafarer - Starts with Navigators Tools and gains expertise in them
- **Active Boon**: Deep Wanderer - Once per long rest, you can ritual cast Water Breathing, however if cast this way it only affects yourself and lasts for one hour.
