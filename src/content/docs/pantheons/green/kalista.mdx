- **Titles**: The Deep Tide, The Siren's Embrace, The Abyssal Queen, The Whisper of the Unplumbed
- **Alignment**: True Neutral
- **Domains**: Water, Tempest, Knowledge
- **Description**: Kalista governs the depths of the oceans, the bounty of all aquatic life, and the silent, crushing pressure of the abyssal dark. She watches over fish, sea creatures, and those who subsist by fishing, ruling over the ebb and flow of all waterâ€”from the smallest spring to the widest sea. Her domain is the vast, amoral power of the deep, embodying the wisdom of unplumbed mysteries and the sudden violence of the storm. She demands absolute respect for the waters and the creatures within, viewing life as just another current.
- **Worshippers**: Sailors, fishermen, coastal communities, aquatic races (such as merfolk and tritons), storm wizards, and explorers of the deep seas. They honor Kalista by leaving offerings of precious objects at the ocean's edge, avoiding the wasteful slaughter of sea creatures, and performing rituals that seek to placate her tempestuous nature.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Crushing Deep Kalista grants you affinity with the elemental power of water and the resilience to survive its depths. You gain a permanent swimming speed equal to your walking speed and you can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per long rest, you can invoke the crushing power of the abyss: when you hit a creature with a spell that deals Cold or Thunder damage, you can choose to impose disadvantage on the creature's next attack roll before the end of its next turn, as they are briefly stunned by immense, unseen pressure.
