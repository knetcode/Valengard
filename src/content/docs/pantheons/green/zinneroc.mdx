- **Titles**: The Feral Sovereign, The Hunter's Instinct, The Tooth and Claw, The Master of the Wild Hunt
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral
- **Domains**: Wild, Beasts, Survival
- **Description**: Zinneroc is the unified deity of all natural beasts, the wild hunt, and the raw instinct necessary for survival. This god embodies the amoral, eternal cycle of predator and prey, ensuring that the necessary culling occurs to maintain the strength of the herds and the purity of the wilderness. Zinneroc demands respect for the chase and the life of all animals, both the hunted and the hunter, acting solely on the drive to preserve the inherent balance of the food chain. His power is the sudden, decisive strike and the silent, patient tracking.
- **Worshippers**: Trackers, Rangers, Barbarians who embrace the savage spirit, hunters, tribal communities who live by the hunt, and those who reject civilization for the pure, unwritten law of the wild. They honor Zinneroc by performing challenging hunts, never letting their kill go to waste, and maintaining their own physical and instinctual prowess.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Feral Sovereign Zinneroc grants you the enhanced senses and predatory speed of the ultimate hunter. You gain Expertise in the Survival skill (doubling your proficiency bonus when making Survival checks). Additionally, once per long rest, you can focus your predatory instinct: as a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. For the next minute, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) check made to find that creature and any attack roll you make against that creature, as if the spirit of the hunter were guiding your every move.
