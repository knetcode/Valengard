| [Zinneroc](/assets/pantheons/green_pantheon/Zinneroc.jpg) | The Feral Sovereign | Chaotic Neutral | Wild, Beasts, Survival | Zinneroc is the unified deity of all natural beasts, the wild hunt, and the raw instinct necessary for survival. This god embodies the amoral, eternal cycle of predator and prey, ensuring that the necessary culling occurs to maintain the strength of the herds. Zinneroc demands respect for the chase and the life of all animals, both the hunted and the hunter. Worshipers are often trackers, rangers, and those who reject civilization for the pure law of the wild.|
