- **Description**: Zinneroc is the unified deity of all natural beasts, the wild hunt, and the raw instinct necessary for survival. This god embodies the amoral, eternal cycle of predator and prey, ensuring that the necessary culling occurs to maintain the strength of the herds and the purity of the wilderness. Zinneroc demands respect for the chase and the life of all animals, both the hunted and the hunter, acting solely on the drive to preserve the inherent balance of the food chain. His power is the sudden, decisive strike and the silent, patient tracking.
- **Worshippers**: Trackers, Rangers, Barbarians who embrace the savage spirit, hunters, tribal communities who live by the hunt, and those who reject civilization for the pure, unwritten law of the wild. They honor Zinneroc by performing challenging hunts, never letting their kill go to waste, and maintaining their own physical and instinctual prowess.
