| [Kalista](/assets/pantheons/green_pantheon/Kalista.jpg) | The Deep Tide | True Neutral | Water, Tempest, Knowledge | Thalassa governs the depths of the oceans, the bounty of all aquatic life, and the silent, crushing pressure of the abyssal dark. She watches over fish, sea creatures, and those who subsist by fishing, ruling over the ebb and flow of all waterâ€”from the smallest spring to the Siren's Embrace. Her domain is the vast, amoral power of the deep, embodying the wisdom of unplumbed mysteries and the sudden violence of the storm. She demands respect for the waters and the creatures within. |
