- **Titles**: The Untamed Wind, The Rider of the Open Sky, The Shaper of Horizons, The Spirit of Unrestrained Change
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Good
- **Domains**: Tempest, Freedom, Air
- **Description**: Kyndra is the deity of open skies, unrestrained winds, and the freedom of the nomadic journey. This god represents the element of air and swift, unpredictable change. Kyndra is worshipped by sailors, traveling merchants, and those who prize liberty and the thrill of new horizons. She encourages mortals to break free from restrictive structures, explore unknown lands, and embrace the wild, random beauty of the world. Her presence is felt in sudden gusts and clear, endless days.
- **Worshippers**: Sailors, traveling merchants, explorers, Monks, airship captains, revolutionaries fighting for liberty, and anyone who lives a life unconstrained by boundaries. They honor Kyndra by leaving offerings atop high peaks, never staying too long in one place, and fighting against tyranny or any system that limits individual freedom.
- **Passive Boon**:
- **Active Boon**: Boon of the Unseen Current Kyndra grants you the swiftness and weightlessness of the open sky. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, once per long rest, you can invoke a personal surge of wind: when you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to push the attacker back 15 feet. If the attacker is Gargantuan or larger, they are pushed back only 5 feet. You can choose to push yourself 15 feet in the opposite direction instead. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
