This god embodies the amoral, eternal cycle of predator and prey, ensuring that the necessary culling occurs to maintain the strength of the herds.

Her domain is the vast, amoral power of the deep, embodying the wisdom of unplumbed mysteries and the sudden violence of the storm. She demands respect for the waters and the creatures within. |
