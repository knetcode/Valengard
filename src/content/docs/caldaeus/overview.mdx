# Caldaeus Map

The setting is the continent of Caldaeus, little is unknown of the other lands within this realm. Below are the descriptions of the different regions as well as some more notable areas within each region.

## The Major Waterways

| Waterway | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| The Spine River (North-South) | This immense river originates in the perpetually frozen Borean Tundra in the far north. It runs straight through the middle of the continent and the Caldaean Heartlands, eventually emptying into the Siren's Embrace. It is the lifeblood for all central civilizations and a crucial trade route. |
| The Serpent's Coil (East-West) | A narrow, winding, massive river that begins in the western Veridian Rainforest, flows eastward through the Ashfall Peaks, and terminates in the vast Lake Veridian in the center-east. |
| The Northern Mare Frigoris | A vast, icy ocean of deadly cold and constant pack ice, bordered by the Borean Tundra. Travel is extremely difficult, limited to reinforced ships and brief summer months. Exploration is permanently blocked by The Ice Barrier, a massive, churning gyre of ever-shifting icebergs, glacial flow, and blinding blizzards that crush any vessel attempting to sail north beyond the immediate coastline. |
| The Western Tempest Ocean | An open, unforgiving ocean bordered by the Camoflagued Coast and Veridian Rainforest. Few ships venture far from the coast. Exploration is impossible due to The Eye of the Abyss, a region of perpetual, unpredictable, and colossal hurricanes and super-storms that spin thousands of miles west. The winds are strong enough to instantly tear sails and splinter hulls, preventing passage through the endless cyclone. |
| The Sunstone Ocean | A deep, warm, and highly trafficked sea that connects the Isles of the Iron Hand to the wider world. It is the primary route for exporting industrial goods from the islands. Exploration is sealed by The Obsidian Wastes, where the water is dangerously superheated due to hidden volcanic rifts. Vast floating fields of solidified volcanic glass (obsidian) and poisonous superheated steam make the eastern passage a lethal, razor-sharp gauntlet. |
| The Siren's Embrace | A wide, tropical ocean known for its warm waters, powerful squalls, and intricate network of islands (including the Corsair Isles). It is the heart of Caldaean piracy. Exploration to the south is impossible due to The Labyrinth of the Veil, an impassable, permanent, and magically dense fog that twists space and time. Ships that enter are never seen again, their navigation systems failing completely within the thick mist. |

## The Central Core: The Caldaean Heartlands

| Region | Landscape | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Royal Plains | Vast, open grasslands, gentle hills, and the convergence of major roads. | The geographic and political center of the continent, known for its deep, fertile soil and excellent road network. It hosts the largest settlements and capital cities, making it the hub for diplomacy, major trade, and the seat of established law and authority. |
| Riverbend Marches | Gently rolling plains leading to wetlands, marshes, and oxbow lakes along the Spine River. | A transitional zone between the dry plains and the river's edge, characterized by periodic flooding. This area is essential for agriculture, supporting massive rice paddies and fishing villages. Its often-soggy terrain is difficult to cross, making it a natural border zone. |
| Veiled Fields | Undulating plains of tall, dense grasses, frequently subject to strong, swirling winds. | This region is more wild and less settled than the Royal Plains. The tall grass hides ancient cairns, minor ruins, and forgotten battlegrounds. Visibility is often poor, and the constant wind makes the air seem alive with sound, making it a place of both mystery and sudden ambushes. |
| The Trade Gap Pass | High, elevated pass, steep, winding mountain roads, and massive choke points formed by high bluffs. | This region is a major, heavily fortified pass that funnels all overland trade between the Central Heartlands and the Sunstone Ocean and Isles of the Iron Hand. It lies south of the Lake Veridian caldera. The road is steep and difficult, requiring frequent toll and guard outposts. Its strategic location makes it the most fiercely contested trade route in the Heartlands, constantly attracting merchants, mercenaries, and brigands. |
| The Great Granary | Wide, flat, intensively farmed fields and scattered, well-established farming villages and hamlets. | The most agriculturally productive region, dedicated almost entirely to growing staple crops. It lacks large cities but is covered in countless small holdings, mills, and silos. This area is the economic foundation of the Heartlands, and controlling its food supply is often a cause of regional conflict. |
| The Mesa Scars | High, dry plateaus, low sandstone bluffs, and deeply cut ravines leading into the eastern lowlands. | The least fertile section of the core, bordering the rugged, western edge of the Ashfall Peaks. The terrain is rougher, dotted with ancient fortifications built into the bluffs and perfect for small, autonomous bandit or mercenary groups who use the ravines for cover. |
| The Recessed Roads | Low-lying, mist-prone valleys and deep river cuts, often featuring ancient, flagstone roads that sink into the earth. | A network of old infrastructure that warps the landscape. The roads are remnants of a powerful former empire and are now often partially flooded or buried, becoming dangerous shortcuts that attract bandits and creatures that thrive in the gloom and moisture. |
| The Stone Circle Uplands | High, exposed plains dotted with numerous ancient megalithic rings, weathered menhirs, and cairns. | A place of spiritual or magical significance, characterized by its dry, short grasses and massive stone monuments. While beautiful, the area is known for strange magical phenomena, unpredictable weather, and powerful spirits tied to the ley lines the stone circles seem to trace. |
| The Silver Mine Hills | Low, rounded hills and small, temperate woodlands crisscrossed with trails leading to numerous active and abandoned mineshafts. | This is the primary source of precious metals for the Heartlands, creating pockets of wealth and dangerous, unsupervised caverns. The region is heavily monitored by guilds and nobles and is a magnet for prospectors, thieves, and underground creatures spilling out of the deep tunnels. |
| The Dragon's Teeth | A chain of abrupt, isolated rock formationsâ€”sheer, tooth-like mountains rising suddenly from the flat plains. | These sharp, unusual peaks are too small to be a range but serve as prominent landmarks and natural fortifications. They are typically crowned by small, heavily guarded castles, powerful monasteries, or the isolated lairs of dangerous beasts, making them highly visible centers of local power. |

## The Northern Reaches

| Region | Landscape | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The Borean Tundra | Frigid Tundra, Permafrost, Glaciers, and deep, frozen fjords along the coast. | The coldest, northernmost point of Caldaeus. Treacherous ice sheets and unforgiving weather define the region, making it a land of isolated settlements focused purely on survival. |
| The Crystal Peaks | Mountainous, High-Altitude Plateaus, Sheer Cliffs, and caves naturally laced with brilliant crystals. | A massive, jagged, snow-capped range that forms a daunting natural barrier. It is home to reclusive communities, hard-to-reach sky citadels, and rich veins of undiscovered mineral wealth. |
| The Frostfang Forest | Vast, ancient boreal forest; dense stands of massive, needle-covered evergreens; perpetually shadowed clearings. | Located south of the Borean Tundra, this forest acts as a cold, natural transition zone. The trees are huge and spaced closely, making ground travel difficult, and very little sunlight reaches the forest floor. It is a land of massive, territorial beasts and reclusive woodcutters who rarely deal with the outside world. |
| The Silver Steppes | High-altitude plains, expansive tracts of low, scrubby brush, and mineral-rich geothermal springs. | A vast, open expanse that stretches between the Frostfang Forest and the Crystal Peaks. Though dry and cold, it is known for mineral wealth (silver and iron) brought up by underground thermal activity. It is mainly inhabited by hardy, nomadic riders and is often a neutral meeting ground for northern trade. |
| The Winter Coast | Rocky coastline, sheltered coves, and shallow, island-dotted waters. | This coastal area is less frigid than the fjords but is defined by constant mist and powerful, choppy seas. The deep coves offer excellent, hidden spots for pirate havens or secretive fishing villages. The ruins of ancient lighthouses and watchtowers dot the bluffs, suggesting a past era of greater sea power. |
| The Ice-Mirror Lake | Great Lake, vast, deep lake surface permanently frozen over with thick, transparent ice. | The largest freshwater body in the north, acting as a crucial resource and a unique form of travel: sleds and carriages speed across its frozen surface in winter. Its depths, however, are largely unexplored, and the lake is rumored to contain powerful, slumbering elemental creatures trapped beneath the ice. |
| The Stone Citadel | Ruins, vast, crumbling stone walls and shattered towers partially buried in the shifting ice and snow of the tundra. | The ruins of a colossal, ancient fortress or capital city that was destroyed and frozen millennia ago. The site is a haunting reminder of the north's power and decline, full of trapped magic, deadly collapses, and artifacts sought by treasure hunters and historians alike. |
| The Glacier Caves | Frozen Cave Lands, winding networks of massive caverns carved into the base of glaciers, filled with glittering ice formations. | This region is defined by immense, natural ice caves that snake for miles beneath the mountains and tundra. The interior is extremely cold and hazardous, featuring deep crevasses and unstable ice bridges, serving as the lairs for frost giants, white dragons, and other colossal, cold-adapted creatures. |
| The Marble Quarry | Great Quarry, massive, open-pit quarry and surrounding camps, featuring veins of high-quality marble and granite. | The primary source of fine building stone in the north, located near the foothills of the Crystal Peaks. It's a busy, industrial site where immense labor is required to extract and transport the material, often creating tension between the mining guilds and local communities. |
| The Whispering Fells | High-altitude moorland, sparse patches of sharp grass, and stone walls surrounding isolated homesteads. | A desolate, elevated transitional area between the steppes and the Heartlands, known for its deep stillness and occasional unnatural silence. It is a place of solitude, often chosen by hermits, mystics, and shepherds, but its isolation makes it vulnerable to sudden, savage attacks from creatures descending from the mountains. |

## The Western Extremity

| Region | Landscape | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The Veridian Rainforest | Rainforests, Dense, Multi-layered Canopy, and incredibly high humidity. | An impossibly dense jungle on the far western coast. It is hot, wet, and teeming with oversized, specialized life. The terrain is a maze of thick foliage, challenging all forms of travel, and conceals ancient, overgrown ruins. |
| The Serpentwood Swamps | Swamp Lands, Murky Delta, Mangroves, and deep, stagnant pools. | Located where the Serpent's Coil begins to slow and spread, this region is defined by oppressive humidity and toxic atmosphere. It is a haven for outcasts, secretive communities, and formidable aquatic or amphibious monsters. |
| The Camoflagued Coast | Beaches, shallow coral reefs, treacherous tidal zones, and cliffs facing the open ocean. | The narrow coastal strip where the rainforest meets the sea. This area is known for powerful currents, hidden smugglers' coves, and settlements built on stilts to withstand the volatile tides. Ancient, half-submerged ruins are often exposed during the lowest tides. |
| The Whispering Canyon | Deep, narrow, mist-filled canyons, sheer rock walls, and winding river tributaries. | A dramatic geographical feature separating the central plains from the true Western Extremity. The perpetual mist and echoing acoustics create strange illusions and carry sound for miles, making stealth or large-scale travel here difficult. It serves as a natural defensive barrier and a home for winged creatures. |
| The Highland Cloud Forest | High-altitude jungle, perpetual cool fog, moss-covered trees, and steep, terraced slopes. | A higher, cooler, and less oppressive jungle region that borders the Veridian Rainforest. The constant cloud cover and cooler temperatures create an environment rich in rare herbs and strange, luminous fungi. It is a highly spiritual and often treacherous place, inhabited by isolated, cliff-dwelling communities. |
| Lake of the Coil | Great Lake, freshwater expanse, deep thermal vents, and rocky, inaccessible shorelines. | Located where the Serpent's Coil emerges from the central Heartlands, this deep, vast lake is fed by underground geothermal springs, keeping it warm year-round. Its shores are rocky and difficult to settle, making it a pristine source of water and aquatic resources, often rumored to hold massive, ancient creatures in its depths. |
| The Whispercap Forest | Mushroom Forest, massive, glowing fungi, porous soil, and perpetual low light. | A bizarre region of fungal overgrowth where towering, luminous mushrooms replace normal trees. The atmosphere is damp and filled with spores, and the light is dim and multicolored. The porous soil hides numerous underground tunnels and fungal hazards, making it a dangerous but magically rich area. |
| The Wind-Swept Plains | Wild Plains, vast, unbroken savanna, tall golden grasses, and wide-open sky. | This region contrasts sharply with the nearby jungles. It's a land of speed and instinct, home to great migratory herds and the large predators that follow them. Settlements here are scarce, usually built as sturdy, defensive compounds to resist the elements and territorial beasts. |
| The Terra-Firma Fields | Vast Farmland, highly organized rows of grain and cotton, irrigation canals, and large, communal barns. | Located where the climate eases toward the Heartlands, this is the region of intensive, cooperative agriculture. It is a massive, cultivated landscape dedicated to producing fiber and grain for the Western Coast and Central Core. Disputes over water rights and labor are common here. |
| The Lost Plateau | Isolated, flat-topped mesas, steep sandstone cliffs, and arid scrub brush. | An elevated, desert-like region bordering the Whispering Canyon. This high ground is difficult to access, and its mesas hold ruins and structures from civilizations that predated the great rainforest. The isolation makes it a perfect hiding place for small, defensive communities or exiled groups. |

## The Eastern Edge

| Region | Landscape | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The Isles of Iron Hand | Archipelago Islands, Coastal cliffs, Sea Stacks, and deep-sea trenches. | Archipelago Islands, Coastal cliffs, Sea Stacks, and deep-sea trenches. A massive chain of islands stretching far into the eastern ocean. These islands are rich in both metal ores and volcanic glass, making them a primary center for industry, shipbuilding, and deep-earth mining operations. |
| Lake Veridian | Great Lakes, Sheltered Shorelines, and Rolling Plains. | Great Lakes, Sheltered Shorelines and Rolling Plains. The largest lake on Caldaeus, fed by the Serpent's Coil. The entire lake basin is naturally fortified with deep forests and towered mountain ranges, creating a virtually impenetrable caldera. Its shores are dotted with highly protected institutions, grand archives, and cities built into the natural stone. The stable, protected climate allows for the meticulous construction and preservation of knowledge, making it a hub for scholars and mages. |
| The Sunstone Delta | Flat, silty delta plain, slow-moving tributaries, and salt marshes leading to the sea. | Flat, silty delta plain, slow-moving tributaries, and salt marshes leading to the sea. Located where major rivers empty before reaching the Isles of the Iron Hand, this low-lying area is prone to shifting geography and mist. It is an excellent site for ports and shipyards that service the island trade routes, but the unstable ground makes large, permanent structures difficult to maintain. |
| The Silverleaf Woods | Extensive temperate forest, clear streams, and low, rounded hills. | Extensive temperate forest, clear streams, and low, rounded hills. A sprawling, ancient forest region that acts as a natural buffer between the Heartlands and Lake Veridian. It is known for its towering hardwood trees and abundant game. Many secluded villages and hermitage sites are hidden deep within its canopy, often maintaining ancient, non-Heartland traditions. |
| The Whisperwind Heights | High, arid steppe and rocky foothills leading into the Northern Crystal Peaks. | High, arid steppe and rocky foothills leading into the Northern Crystal Peaks. This elevated area is a transition zone characterized by constant, strong, dry winds. It is sparsely populated and dominated by massive stone formations and wind-worn ruins. The heights offer unmatched visibility and serve as key defensive positions, making them desirable for border forts and observation posts. |
| The Jagged Spires | Jagged Mountain Edge, razor-sharp granite peaks, steep, unstable scree slopes, and deep, cold ravines. | Jagged Mountain Edge, razor-sharp granite peaks, steep, unstable scree slopes, and deep, cold ravines. This smaller, violently shaped mountain range forms a sharp, dangerous natural boundary on one side of the Lake Veridian basin. Travel is extremely treacherous, requiring specialized climbing or flight. The peaks are riddled with caves that act as havens for harpies, griffons, and other territorial monsters. |
| The Gloomwood | Great Magical Forest, twisted, ancient trees, perpetual twilight, and intensely dense, magically resistant foliage. | Great Magical Forest, twisted, ancient trees, perpetual twilight, and intensely dense, magically resistant foliage. A vast, dark, enchanted forest that surrounds a portion of the Lake Veridian defenses. The air here is thick with low-level, protective enchantments, and the trees themselves seem to shift and reorient paths. It is deliberately difficult to navigate, and any cutting or burning of the wood is met with fierce, magical retaliation. |
| The Glimmering Fens | Perilous Region, wide, deep quagmires, bioluminescent swamps, and pools of noxious, elemental runoff. | Perilous Region, wide, deep quagmires, bioluminescent swamps, and pools of noxious, elemental runoff. A bizarre and deadly lowland swamp region, likely fed by strange runoff from the Ashfall Peaks or arcane accidents from Lake Veridian. The stagnant water and marsh gas create a psychedelic, often toxic environment. It is home to mutated creatures and dangerous elemental spirits. |
| The Iron Road | High, dry plateaus connecting the Sunstone Delta and the Whisperwind Heights, featuring massive, durable trade arteries. | High, dry plateaus connecting the Sunstone Delta and the Whisperwind Heights, featuring massive, durable trade arteries. A region defined by its role as a corridor. Unlike the older roads, this one is modern and well-maintained, built from dark, volcanic stone from the Islands. It's crucial for troop movement and industrial transport, making it a target for sabotage and banditry. |
| The Stone Fields | Flat, desolate plains covered in millions of golf-ball-sized, perfectly smooth, colorless stones. | Flat, desolate plains covered in millions of golf-ball-sized, perfectly smooth, colorless stones. An unnaturally featureless landscape created by ancient geological or magical forces. It offers no cover, and the constant clicking and rolling of the stones in the wind can drive travelers mad. It is used primarily as a military staging ground due to its lack of resources or cover. |

## The Southern Coasts

| Region | Landscape | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The Blazing Sands | Desert, Massive Sand Dunes, Rocky Mesas, and scarce, life-giving Oases. | Stretching across the southwestern portion of the continent, this great desert is a vast, sun-baked wasteland. It is home to nomadic tribes, hidden tombs, and creatures adapted to extreme heat and aridity. |
| The Ashfall Peaks | Volcanic, Geysers, Black Sand Beaches, and actively volcanic mountains. | This smaller but highly active mountain chain runs along the southeastern coast. It's an area of constant geological turmoil, defined by sulfurous smoke, molten rock, and raw, unpredictable power. The terrain offers challenging ground for establishing strongholds but hides geothermal energy sources and unique materials. |
| The Corsair Isles | Tropical Archipelago, Hidden coves, Volcanic remnants, Barrier reefs, and lush jungle foliage. | A sprawling chain of hundreds of small, jungle-covered islands that define the Southern Azure Sea. This natural maze is a perfect hiding spot, making it the central hub for organized pirate fleets and independent smugglers. Ancient, tide-swept ruins are often found on the less-traveled islands. |
| The Sunken Jungle | Humid, lowland jungle, tangled thickets, and mist-shrouded sinkholes leading to underground rivers. | A dense, warm jungle that serves as a barrier between the Blazing Sands and the fertile Heartlands. It is characterized by deep ravines and geological faults where the earth has collapsed, creating dangerous pits and access points to vast subterranean cave networks. |
| The Ironwood Hills | Dry, scrub-covered hills, wind-swept ridges, and scattered stands of extremely hard, dark-wood trees. | A rugged, inland region that transitions the plains of the Heartlands to the arid south. The wood here is prized for its density and durability, leading to heavy logging and frequent skirmishes over timber rights. The barren hills are home to numerous small, isolated fortresses built from the tough ironwood. |
| The Forgotten Sands | Desert Ruins, Massive, eroded tombs, monuments, and ancient, crumbling sphinxes. | Located deep within the harshest part of the Blazing Sands, this region is the ruin of a lost, monumental civilization. Its vast, ancient tombs and buried cities are a treasure trove for archaeologists, a hunting ground for treasure hunters, and a source of powerful undead guardians and curses. |
| Lake Thirst's End | Great Desert Lake, Massive freshwater oasis, Lush reed beds, and surrounding salt flats. | A colossal, life-giving lake located at the convergence of several underground water sources in the desert. It is the only guaranteed source of fresh water in the south, making it a critical strategic point, a center for diverse, unique animal life, and the home of several permanent desert settlements. |
| Mount Cinder | Massive Active Volcano, Sulfurous fumaroles, Lava tubes, and surrounding wasteland of ash and cinders. | The single largest and most dangerous volcano in the Ashfall Peaks, constantly spewing smoke and occasionally lava. Its immediate vicinity is lethal, but the lava tubes and deep fissures hold rare magical minerals and provide natural, easily defended (though unstable) underground lairs. |
| The Whispering Canyon | Deep, narrow, mist-filled canyons, sheer rock walls, and winding river tributaries. | A dramatic geographical feature separating the central plains from the true Western Extremity. The perpetual mist and echoing acoustics create strange illusions and carry sound for miles, making stealth or large-scale travel here difficult. It serves as a natural defensive barrier and a home for winged creatures. |
| The Obsidian Coast | Rocky, volcanic coastline, black sand beaches, and sheer sea cliffs carved by constant high-tide waves. | This coastline is dominated by the erosion of the Ashfall Peaks, featuring sharp, black volcanic rock and few natural harbors. The lack of easy landing makes it a highly defensible coast for the kingdoms based in the Ashfall Peaks, but the dark, treacherous waters are haunted by unique deep-sea predators. |
