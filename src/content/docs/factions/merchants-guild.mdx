## Merchants Guild

- Description: A centralized body to whom most of the continent's major merchants belong. They regulate the established trade routes, govern fair trade practices and set tariffs. While not directly involved in the politics of the kingdom, they constantly seek to establish strong, protective ties to major factions, cities, and kingdoms in order to gain exclusive access to valuable resources and armed protection from looters, brigands, and pirates.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The Iron Road. A modern, well-maintained arterial road that connects their main ports in the Sunstone Delta directly to the high trade-route Trade Gap Pass. Their fortress-banks are built from the durable, dark volcanic stone.
- Motto: "Coin is king."
- Novice Boon: Whenever you roll a 9 or lower on the d20 for a Persuasion check for trading, you can treat the number as a 10.
- Penalty: Any time you are caught participating in public act of low taste, you are fined 25gp by the guild.
