## The Bound Battalion

- Description: Description: The Bound Battalion is a mercenary regiment composed entirely of convicted criminals who have opted for a "Sentence of Service" rather than traditional imprisonment. Under a special legal decree, prisoners can sign a contract that allows them to pay off their debt to society not with years of their life, but with successful missions, gold earned, and quantifiable risk taken on the battlefield. The Battalion is notoriously disciplined (fear of failure is a powerful motivator) and highly effective, as the members are fighting for their most valuable possession: freedom. They are often deployed into the most hazardous zones—plague-ridden areas, fortified enemy strongholds, or unstable magical ruins—where their lives are considered expendable.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The central office is located in the Royal Plains, however most major cities have a garrison to manage their own battalions.
- Motto: A Debt Paid in Blood, a Freedom Earned in Iron.
- Novice Boon: Your rune collar grants you advantage of death saving throws. Once per day, when you reach 0 hitpoints, your rune collar will grant you 1 hitpoint.
- Penalty: Should you disobey your commander, your rune collar will explode.
