title: Tomekeepers
---

- **Description**: A meticulous order dedicated to the collection, indexing, and preservation of all knowledgeâ€”magical, historical, and cultural. They are the world's knowledge keepers. The two branches are the Archivists (those who guard, catalogue, and preserve data in static repositories) and the Researchers (who are scholars, adventurers, and travelers, seeking to recover lost knowledge from ancient ruins and forgotten civilizations). They value objective truth and tireless work above all else, seeing all knowledge as a bulwark against future ignorance and catastrophe.
- **Motto**: "To forget is to fail. To record is to ensure the future."

- **Novice Boon**: You can spend an action to make an exactly record any single piece of visible information to your tome even if you cannot understand it
- **Penalty**: Your dedication to preserving knowledge is paramount. You are compelled to prevent the willful destruction of books, scrolls, or documents (magical or mundane) that are rare or contain unique information, even if doing so puts you or the party at risk.
