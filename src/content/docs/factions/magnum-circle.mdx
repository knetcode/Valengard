## Magnum Circle

- Description: The highest-tier guild of enchanters, metalsmiths, woodsmiths, and jewelers. They set the standards for quality across the continent. Though they wield considerable economic power due to their functional monopoly, their organization is as more about quality control and craftsmanship than it is about wealth and market dominance. They are driven by the sheer art of the craft as opposed to profit.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Their vast, constantly burning Great Forge and primary workshops are located on the Isles of Iron Hand due to the abundance of raw materials, with large, exclusive guildhouses in major cities.
- Motto: "A master's touch turns material into perfection."
- Novice Boon: You gain proficiency with a type of Artisan's Tools (Jeweler's, Smith's, or Woodcarver's) and can spend 10 minutes identifying any crafted magical equpiment or weapons.
- Penalty: The Cost of Perfection. You appreciate well master crafted items more than the average person, you pay 10% more master crafted items.
