title: Green Weavers
---

- **Description**: A decentralized circle of druids, wardens, and shamans who seek to maintain the natural balance of Valengard. They are less concerned with mortal civilization and more with the health of the wild and the elemental world, protecting ancient ecosystems from unchecked growth, industrial exploitation, or dark corruption. They meet at sacred sites periodically to share wisdom, news and coordinate defenses, acting as the wild and often unseen immune system of the continent.
- **Motto**: "The seed must fall that the forest may grow."

- **Novice Boon**: Whenver you rest in nature, the wilds themselves protect you. You can spend 10 minutes to consecrate a Natural Sanctuary. You cannot be surprise attacked, the fauna itself will provide rations for your party.
- **Penalty**: You are compelled to protect all forms of nature and cannot willingly harm the green other than for reasons of self-defense or survival.
