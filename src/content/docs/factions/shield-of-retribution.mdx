## The Shield of Retribution

- Description: Elite, disciplined warriors sworn to protect the innocent, fight against oppression, and uphold the peace. More than mere city guards, they are organized into highly trained, mobile chapters that focus on disaster relief, defending remote settlements, and actively seeking out systemic injustices and sources of large-scale evil. Their primary mission is active defense, deploying rapidly to contested areas like the Trade Gap Pass or the wilds of the Whispering Fells to protect the weak and avenge those victimized by oppressors. Their devotion to order is matched only by their unwavering personal courage.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: While their main Chapter House found near the political center in the Royal Plains, their forces are constantly dispersed throughout the most contested and troubled areas.
- Motto: "Our steel is not for conquest, but for the unwavering defense of meek."
- Novice Boon: Your will to protect manifests. Once per round, you can spend your bonus action to grant an ally you can see the benefits of your equipped shield until the start of your next turn. When used, you lose the benefits of your equipped shield.
- Penalty: You cannot willingly abandon an ally or a non-hostile creature whose current hit points are below one-quarter of its maximum. You are compelled to defend them, using your movement and actions to keep them safe until they are above the threshold, stabilized, or removed from immediate danger.
