title: Silent Watch
---

- **Description**: An unsanctioned, ruthless organization that serves as the self-appointed final arbiter of justice. They have no official jurisdiction and actively avoid political ties, viewing established laws as often corruptible or ineffective. They intervene wherever systemic injustice occurs and where the law fails to bring justice. Highly decentralized and elusive, the Watch has no permanent, public headquarters, operating alone or in small, temporary cells, often undercover and relying on coded signals and a network of secretive safe houses. Their power comes from their anonymity, their mastery of investigation, and their reputation for acting swiftly and decisively.
- **Motto**: "Justice is cold, impartial, and without exception."

- **Novice Boon**: You can ably create written ciphers. Others can't decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC equal to your Intelligence score + your proficiency bonus), or they use magic to decipher it. You also have advantage when attempting Investigation skill checks.
- **Penalty**: You develop a cold intolerance for procedural error. You have Disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check made to convince an established authority figure (guard captain, judge, noble) to bend or break a lawful rule.
