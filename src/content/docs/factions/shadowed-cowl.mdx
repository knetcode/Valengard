title: Shadow Cowl
---

- **Description**: A meticulous and highly disciplined organization of spies, information brokers. Their intricate information networks span all layers of society, from the highest noble courts to the lowest dockside taverns. They deal in pure, unvarnished informationâ€”the ultimate commodity. They are rarely seen and are defined by their anonymity and efficiency. They are virtually impossible to track. They have been united under the Great Shadow along with the Shadowed Hand and Shadowed Dagger as a pseudo-organization.
- **Headquarters/Operating Area**: Veiled Fields provide excellent conditions for spies to disappear into the tall grass, misty areas and ancient cairns.
- **Motto**: "Loose lips open all doors."
