# Factions

## The Shield of Retribution

- Description: Elite, disciplined warriors sworn to protect the innocent, fight against oppression, and uphold the peace. More than mere city guards, they are organized into highly trained, mobile chapters that focus on disaster relief, defending remote settlements, and actively seeking out systemic injustices and sources of large-scale evil. Their primary mission is active defense, deploying rapidly to contested areas like the Trade Gap Pass or the wilds of the Whispering Fells to protect the weak and avenge those victimized by oppressors. Their devotion to order is matched only by their unwavering personal courage.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: While their main Chapter House found near the political center in the Royal Plains, their forces are constantly dispersed throughout the most contested and troubled areas.
- Motto: "Our steel is not for conquest, but for the unwavering defense of meek."

## Silent Watch

- Description: An unsanctioned, ruthless organization that serves as the self-appointed final arbiter of justice. They have no official jurisdiction and actively avoid political ties, viewing established laws as often corruptible or ineffective. They intervene wherever systemic injustice occurs and where the law fails to bring justice. Highly decentralized and elusive, the Watch has no permanent, public headquarters, operating alone or in small, temporary cells, often undercover and relying on coded signals and a network of secretive safe houses. Their power comes from their anonymity, their mastery of investigation, and their reputation for acting swiftly and decisively.
- Operating Area: Anywhere injustice festers, from the bureaucratic centers to isolated settlements. Justice knows no borders, and the Watch operates in the shadows.
- Motto: "Justice is cold, impartial, and without exception."

## Tomekeepers

- Description: A meticulous order dedicated to the collection, indexing, and preservation of all knowledge—magical, historical, and cultural. They are the world's knowledge keepers. The two branches are the Archivists (those who guard, catalogue, and preserve data in static repositories) and the Researchers (who are scholars, adventurers, and travelers, seeking to recover lost knowledge from ancient ruins and forgotten civilizations). They value objective truth and tireless work above all else, seeing all knowledge as a bulwark against future ignorance and catastrophe.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The location of the mythical Great Library is unknown. Their public-facing central hub is the Axiomatic Repository built deep into the natural defenses of Lake Veridian, with smaller hubs scattered throughout the continent.
- Motto: "To forget is to fail. To record is to ensure the future."

## Magnum Circle

- Description: The highest-tier guild of enchanters, metalsmiths, woodsmiths, and jewelers. They set the standards for quality across the continent. Though they wield considerable economic power due to their functional monopoly, their organization is as more about quality control and craftsmanship than it is about wealth and market dominance. They are driven by the sheer art of the craft as opposed to profit.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Their vast, constantly burning Great Forge and primary workshops are located on the Isles of Iron Hand due to the abundance of raw materials, with large, exclusive guildhouses in major cities.
- Motto: "A master's touch turns material into perfection."

## Stone Smiths

- Description: A comprehensive guild managing all aspects of stonework, civil engineering, and subsurface resource extraction. They are responsible for the stability of cities, the defense and construction of deep mines, and the development of major, lasting infrastructure across Caldaeus. Their members are master masons, architects, and miners who prize permanence, precision, and safety in their work, often clashing with those who prioritize speed or unstable magical materials.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Governed by their three major guild halls operate in the Isles of Iron Hand, the Marble Quarry and the Silver Mine Hills.
- Motto: "The foundation must hold eternal."

## The Arcanum

- Description: A powerful, secretive academy and guild dedicated to the eternal pursuit of magical power and understanding. Their scholars conduct risky experiments to master every field of magic. They prioritize the expansion of their magical strength and theoretical knowledge over any ethical concerns, which often brings them into sharp ideological conflict with other learned societies. Their citadel is a fortress designed to withstand the backlash of their most dangerous research.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: They operate out of the heavily defended located in the Jagged Spires atop the Lake Veridian caldera.
- Motto: "Power is not a gift, but a formula to be solved."

## Green Weavers

- Description: A decentralized circle of druids, wardens, and shamans who seek to maintain the natural balance of Valengard. They are less concerned with mortal civilization and more with the health of the wild and the elemental world, protecting ancient ecosystems from unchecked growth, industrial exploitation, or dark corruption. They meet at sacred sites periodically to share wisdom, news and coordinate defenses, acting as the wild and often unseen immune system of the continent.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Their major gathering place is the ancient monoliths of the Stone Circle Uplands. They protect key ecological zones like the Veridian Rainforest and the Serpentwood Swamps.
- Motto: "The seed must fall that the forest may grow."

## Shadowflame Knights

- Description: A brutally effective, monastic order of battle-hardened knights who have dedicated themselves to fighting extraplanar threats—primarily Demons from The Abyss and Devils from The Nine Hells. To gain the necessary power to face such foes, they employ captured demonic artifacts, dark pacts, and morally compromising tactics (such as forbidden rituals or soul-binding). They are a grim, cold, and feared order, but they are undeniably effective, serving as Valengard's last line of defense against annihilation from the Outer Planes.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Thier fortress is built into the most geologically active and easily defended part of the Ashfall Peaks.
- Motto: "The sword that burns with the enemy's fire."

## Corsair Cartel

- Description: A loose collective of independent pirate crews, smugglers, and freebooters who share a code of radical freedom from all crowns, laws, and taxes. They have an intricate, deep understanding of the waters of the south, particularly the complex maze of the Corsair Isles and the treacherous squalls of the Siren's Embrace. They rarely unite under a single banner, but in times of need or against common enemies, they can pool resources to form a formidable, if chaotic, fleet, dedicated entirely to maintaining their free, lawless way of life.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Primarily the complex maze of the Corsair Isles but sail all the known seas. Their largest public "port" is a heavily fortified, hidden city built into the deepest coves of the Corsair Isles.
- Motto: "The only king on the wave is the tide."

## College of the Lustrous Lute

- Description: The most prominent Bard's college of the continent, dedicated to the mastery and spread of the narrative arts, song, and dance. Their members travel constantly, acting as diplomats and morale boosters for those in need. They believe that music and story are the most powerful forces for change, able to sway rulers, inspire armies, and alter the public's perception of events. Their headquarters is chosen for the resonant acoustic properties of the stone and mist, perfect for enchanting performances.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The low-lying Recessed Roads are mist-prone valleys and ancient flagstone roads that are believed to be acoustically and magically resonant, making them perfect for secretive, mood-altering performances and gatherings.
- Motto: "A sweet word is sharper than the sword."

## Coiled Root Coven

- Description: An ancient, powerful collective of Witches who have dedicated themselves to the deepest, often darkest, mystic arts. They are extremely fickle and seem only to serve their own inscrutable, long-term goals, although they will sometimes manipulate events under the guise of a more noble cause. They practice primal magic, specializing in curses, hexes, and the harvesting of rare, often toxic, ingredients from the swamp's depths. They rarely deal with outsiders, preferring to exert their influence through whispers and strange, potent enchantments.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The Serpentwood Swamps. Their deepest lairs are hidden among the stagnant pools and mangroves, thriving in the oppressive humidity and toxic atmosphere.
- Motto: "The root is the root of all things."

## Merchants Guild

- Description: A centralized body to whom most of the continent's major merchants belong. They regulate the established trade routes, govern fair trade practices and set tariffs. While not directly involved in the politics of the kingdom, they constantly seek to establish strong, protective ties to major factions, cities, and kingdoms in order to gain exclusive access to valuable resources and armed protection from looters, brigands, and pirates.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The Iron Road. A modern, well-maintained arterial road that connects their main ports in the Sunstone Delta directly to the high trade-route Trade Gap Pass. Their fortress-banks are built from the durable, dark volcanic stone.
- Motto: "Coin is king."

## The Shroud

- Description: A meticulous and highly disciplined organization of spies, information brokers, and silent executioners. Their intricate information networks span all layers of society, from the highest noble courts to the lowest dockside taverns. They deal in pure, unvarnished information—the ultimate commodity. They are rarely seen and are defined by their anonymity and cold efficiency. They are virtually impossible to track.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The Glacier Caves (Northern Reaches). Their subterranean fortresses are deep within the massive, cold caverns beneath the permafrost, using the extreme cold and darkness to mask the head of their operations the span the continent.
- Motto: "Loose lips open all doors."

## Order of the Sun

- Description: A monastic order of fanatical inquisitors, dedicated to the absolute eradication of the undead, vampires, lycanthropes, and various creatures of the night. Their zeal is absolute, and their methods are often harsh, involving public purges, cleansing fires, and relentless patrols of dark or ruined areas. They view their work as a divine mandate to bring purifying light to the shadows. They favor elevated, desolate locations for their citadels, using the wide-open views for surveillance and the isolation to maintain their spiritual purity.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: A sun drenched fortress on the edge of the Whispering Fells, provides a sancutary for spiritual meditation.
- Motto: "We burn the shadow so that the world may see the light."

## The Unseen Hand

- Description: The over-arching thieves' guild of the continent. Their organization is defined by intricate specialization: pickpockets, safe-crackers, confidence artists, and master burglars. Thievery is both the profession and the sport, and they operate under a strict code: Drawing blood for the steal is forbidden by the guild and punishable by death. This rule protects their anonymity and ensures they are viewed as a manageable nuisance rather than a terrorist threat. Their extensive networks and knowledge of every city's weak points make them an unstoppable force in the shadows.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: In the sprawling network of underground corridors, hidden basements and false front businesses in the Trade Gap Pass
- Motto: "To steal a crown without breaking a single seal."

## The Bound Battalion

- Description: Description: The Bound Battalion is a mercenary regiment composed entirely of convicted criminals who have opted for a "Sentence of Service" rather than traditional imprisonment. Under a special legal decree, prisoners can sign a contract that allows them to pay off their debt to society not with years of their life, but with successful missions, gold earned, and quantifiable risk taken on the battlefield. The Battalion is notoriously disciplined (fear of failure is a powerful motivator) and highly effective, as the members are fighting for their most valuable possession: freedom. They are often deployed into the most hazardous zones—plague-ridden areas, fortified enemy strongholds, or unstable magical ruins—where their lives are considered expendable.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: The central office is located in the Royal Plains, however most major cities have a garrison to manage their own battalions.
- Motto: A Debt Paid in Blood, a Freedom Earned in Iron.
