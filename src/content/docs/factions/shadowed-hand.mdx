title: Shadowed Hand
---

- **Description**: The over-arching thieves' guild of the continent. Their organization is defined by intricate specialization: pickpockets, safe-crackers, confidence artists, and master burglars. Thievery is both the profession and the sport, and they operate under a strict code: Drawing blood for the steal is forbidden by the guild and punishable by exile. This rule protects their anonymity and ensures they are viewed as a manageable nuisance rather than a terrorist threat. Their extensive networks and knowledge of every city's weak points make them an unstoppable force in the shadows. They have been united under the Great Shadow along with the Shadowed Cowl and Shadowed Dagger as a pseudo-organization.
- **Headquarters/Operating Area**: In the sprawling network of underground corridors, hidden basements and false front businesses in the Trade Gap Pass
- **Motto**: "To steal a crown without breaking a single seal."
