title: Corsair Cartel
---

- **Description**: A loose collective of independent pirate crews, smugglers, and freebooters who share a code of radical freedom from all crowns, laws, and taxes. They have an intricate, deep understanding of the waters of the south, particularly the complex maze of the Corsair Isles and the treacherous squalls of the Siren's Embrace. They rarely unite under a single banner, but in times of need or against common enemies, they can pool resources to form a formidable, if chaotic, fleet, dedicated entirely to maintaining their free, lawless way of life.
- **Motto**: "The only king on the wave is the tide."

- **Novice Boon**: Your swim speed is equal to regular move speed, you can also hold your breath for up to ten minutes.
- **Penalty**: You scoff at absolute authority, you are openly disrespectful against authoritarian figure heads
