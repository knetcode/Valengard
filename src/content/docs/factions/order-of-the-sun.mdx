title: Order of the Sun
---

- **Description**: A monastic order of fanatical inquisitors, dedicated to the absolute eradication of the undead. Their zeal is absolute, and their methods are often harsh, involving public purges, cleansing fires, and relentless patrols of dark or ruined areas. They view their work as a divine mandate to bring purifying light to the shadows. They favor elevated, desolate locations for their citadels, using the wide-open views for surveillance and the isolation to maintain their spiritual purity.
- **Headquarters/Operating Area**: A sun drenched fortress on the edge of the Whispering Fells, provides a sancutary for spiritual meditation.
- **Motto**: "We burn the shadow so that the world may see the light."

- **Penalty**: You abhor the Undead and Necromancy and are compelled to attack any undead or necromancers if you are aware of its presence.
