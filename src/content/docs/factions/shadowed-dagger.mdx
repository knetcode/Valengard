- **Description**: Notoriously efficient silent executioners, known for never engaging in open battle, these ruthless and cold-blooded killers use nefarious means to eliminate their targets silently and without a trace. Contracts cannot be requested, not much is known about how their targets are choosen. They have been united under the Great Shadow along with the Shadowed Cowl and Shadowed Hand as a pseudo-organization.
- **Headquarters/Operating Area**: The Mesa Scars provide natural fortifications and multiple entrances and exits provide the necessary landscape for evasion.
- **Motto**: "Dead men tell no lies."

- **Novice Boon**: You gain proficiency in Poisoner's tools. Whenever you make a weapon attack from stealth you can immediately spend your reaction to re-enter stealth, this stealth check is made with advantage.
- **Penalty**: You will be required to complete contracts from time to time. You may not leave this faction.
