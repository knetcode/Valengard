## Shadowflame Knights

- Description: A brutally effective, monastic order of battle-hardened knights who have dedicated themselves to fighting extraplanar threatsâ€”primarily Demons from The Abyss and Devils from The Nine Hells. To gain the necessary power to face such foes, they employ captured demonic artifacts, dark pacts, and morally compromising tactics (such as forbidden rituals or soul-binding). They are a grim, cold, and feared order, but they are undeniably effective, serving as Valengard's last line of defense against annihilation from the Outer Planes.
- Headquarters/Operating Area: Thier fortress is built into the most geologically active and easily defended part of the Ashfall Peaks.
- Motto: "The sword that burns with the enemy's fire."
- Novice Boon: You are bestowed with Shadowflame Plate and a Shadowflame Blade and immediately gain proficiency with the items. Whenever you a struck with an attack from an Outsider, you return damage equal to your character level as Necrotic damage. When attacking an Outsider with the Shadowflame Blade, you deal an additional d6 of Necrotic damage equal to you proficiency bonus
- Penalty: You abhor the presence of Outsiders and will be immediately hostile toward them. This could be anything from openly hostile to attack on sight depending on the nature of the Outsider.
